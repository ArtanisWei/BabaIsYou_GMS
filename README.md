# Baba Is You in Game Maker Studio 2.0

I am learning GMS 2.0 and this project is only for practicing. 
I'm just imitating other people's great ideas, and if you like it, you can buy the original version on Steam. (https://store.steampowered.com/app/736260/Baba_Is_You/)

How to play:
- Up / Down / Left / Right : Move "YOU"
- R : Restart this level
- ESC : Back to menu
- ~~Z ï¼š Undo (Not finished yet)~~

This version contains five levels with these entities:

- Wall
- Rock
- Flag
- Gear

and these adjective:
- You
- Stop
